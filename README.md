# my-functional-path

*Best way to learn, is to learn for someone else.*

This repository is meant to track and share my progress relating to functional programming. For the guide I am using mostly-adequate-guide (https://mostly-adequate.gitbook.io/mostly-adequate-guide/#do-it-yourself). This guide is meant for Javascript, but additionally I will be learning to write the same programs in Perl as well.

The repository will be structured in a way that there will be a folder containing notes and any programs written both in Javascript as well as with Perl.

Note: Notes can be cursed, as I respect note taking but additionally, I am a lazy note taker. For me, often a single word does the trick of firing neurons the right way, thus, this repository is mostly intended to be a reference rather than a learning resource. Additionally, it is a tough task to find good resources about learning clean functional programming with Perl and since I am only starting out with it, the programs can be unsophisticated.

I am thrilled to step into the world of Perl, and functional programming!
